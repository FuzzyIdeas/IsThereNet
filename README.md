## Installation

- Download, unzip, move to `/Applications`


## What does this do?

IsThereNet watches for internet connection status changes and draws a colored line at the top of the screen to indicate the status.

Colors:

- üü¢ **Green**: connected *(fades out after 5 seconds)*
- üî¥ **Red**: disconnected *(stays on screen until connection is restored)*
- üü° **Yellow**: slow internet *(fades out after 10 seconds)*

The top status line does not appear in screenshots and does not interfere with clicking on the menu bar.

## How does it achieve that?

IsThereNet uses the native [NWPathMonitor](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/nwpathmonitor) API to efficiently check if a connection can be established to Cloudflare's DNS IP `1.1.1.1`.

That IP was chosen for multiple reasons:

- it should connect to a server that's close to you
- it's a well-known IP that's unlikely to change
- it's unlikely to be blocked by firewalls
- it should not sell your data to advertisers like Google's `8.8.8.8` does


## Uh.. how do I quit this app?

The app has no Dock icon and no menubar icon so to quit it you'd need to do *one of the following*:

- Launch **Activity Monitor**, find **IsThereNet** and press the ‚ùå button at the top
- Run the following command in the Terminal: `killall 'IsThereNet'`

## Alternatives

If you want to monitor more complex network conditions, you can use a few different alternatives:

- [iStat Menus](https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/) which is a paid app but does a lot more than just network monitoring (CPU, RAM, Disk, etc)
- [PeakHour](https://peakhourapp.com/) which is a subscription-based app that does a lot of network monitoring, latency checks, etc

## Logging

IsThereNet logs internet connection status changes to:

- the system log (accessible via Console.app)
- to a file in `~/Library/Containers/com.lowtechguys.IsThereNet/Data/Library/Caches/IsThereNet.log`
- to the command line if you run the binary directly
