## Launch at login

Now launch at login can be configured through the config file.

The config file is located at:

```sh
~/.config/istherenet/config.json
```

The config now supports a new key `launchAtLogin` which can be set to `true` or `false`:

```json
{
    ...
    "launchAtLogin": false, // default is true
    ...
}
```
