## Auto-updater

Since v1.6, IsThereNet will automatically check for updates every 3 days.

## Multi-monitor support

The status line can now be shown on all screens.

There's also a new `screen` config key which can be set to:

- `all` (default): show status line on all screens
- `main` (previous behaviour): show status line only on the main screen
- screen name: can be part of the name like *"built-in"* or "Dell"

## Run command on status change

IsThereNet can now run a shell command when the connection status changes.

To configure this, the config key `shellCommandOnStatusChange` was added.

The command is run using the following invocation:

```sh
/bin/zsh -c "
    STATUS=CONNECTED; # can be one of CONNECTED, DISCONNECTED, SLOW
	PING_TIME=18;     # can be 0 for DISCONNECTED or >0 for CONNECTED or SLOW
	shellCommandOnStatusChange
"
```

The app is also no longer sandboxed to allow for shell commands to run with more permissions.

NOTE: if you want to run a Shortcut instead, you can use the `/usr/bin/shortcuts run` command-line.

## Simpler paths

Because we're no longer limited by the sandbox, we've moved the config and logs to shorter paths that don't have spaces in them:

| Description            | Path                                |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Config                 | `~/.config/istherenet/config.json`  |
| App Logs               | `~/.logs/istherenet.log`            |
| Shell command logs     | `~/.logs/istherenet-shell-cmd.log`  |
